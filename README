Frequency shift keying (FSK) 

technique is used to modulate digital signals so they can be transmitted wirelessly. 
ex., Bluetooth uses form of FSK called gaussian FSK ( GFSK ).
We will focus on binary FSK ( BFSK ), which uses two frequency values to represent a binary value of 1 and 0. 
The data is converted to these frequencies, transmitted, and then demodulated.


	  _____     _______________     _____________	  ________     ________
	 |     |   |       	   |   |	     |	 |        |   |        |
INPUT -->| VCO |-->| noisy channel |-->|diffrentiator|-->| filter |-->| slicer |--> MODULATED 
	 |_____|   |_______________|   |_____________|	 |________|   |________|       OUT



Since we dealing with BFSK ( Binary ) input could be represented as 0 and 1:
				
				y(t) = +F_dev	( => 0 )
				y(t) = -F_dev	( => 1 )

				F-dev = Frequency deviation. ie., difference w.r.t Carrier

Modelling the VCO , it bears two frequencies:
				
				F_carrier + F_dev
				F_carrier - F_dev

VCO could be modelled via :
				z = Acos( 2 * pi * ( F_carrier + y(t) ) * t )

				z => transmitted signal
				A => Amplitude of transmitted signal

Noisy channel ,transmitting over air will induce a noise factor modelled by:
				
				z = Acos( 2 * pi * ( F_carrier + y(t) ) * t ) + n(t)

				n(t) => noise model

Differentiator separates the data signal from the carrier frequency:
					
		dz                                     d y(t)					      dn(t)
		-- = -A*2*pi* ( f_carrier + y(t) + t * ------ )*sin*(2*pi*( f_carrier + y(t) ) * t )* -----
		dt				         dt						dt
		
		  	   	    dy(t)			
dropping phase shift, term -> ( t * ----- ) is 0 due to constant shift in frequeny:
		   	             dt

		dz                                 				     dn(t)
		-- = -A*2*pi*( f_carrier + y(t) )*sin*(2*pi*( f_carrier + y(t) )*t)* -----
		dt								      dt
