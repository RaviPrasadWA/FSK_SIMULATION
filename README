Frequency shift keying (FSK) 

technique is used to modulate digital signals so they can be transmitted wirelessly. 
ex., Bluetooth uses form of FSK called gaussian FSK ( GFSK ).
We will focus on binary FSK ( BFSK ), which uses two frequency values to represent a binary value of 1 and 0. 
The data is converted to these frequencies, transmitted, and then demodulated.

	 |_____|	  |_______________|	   |_______________|	   |________|	    |________|		OUT



Since we dealing with BFSK ( Binary ) input could be represented as 0 and 1:
				
				y(t) = +F_dev	( => 0 )
				y(t) = -F_dev	( => 1 )

				F-dev = Frequency deviation. ie., difference w.r.t Carrier

Modelling the VCO , it bears two frequencies:
				
				F_carrier + F_dev
				F_carrier - F_dev

VCO could be modelled via :
				z = Acos( 2 * pi * ( F_carrier + y(t) ) * t )

				z => transmitted signal
				A => Amplitude of transmitted signal

Noisy channel ,transmitting over air will induce a noise factor modelled by:
				
				z = Acos( 2 * pi * ( F_carrier + y(t) ) * t ) + n(t)

				n(t) => noise momdel
